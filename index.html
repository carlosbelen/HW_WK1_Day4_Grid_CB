                Magawa is an African giant pouched rat, trained to detect landmines by the international non-profit APOPO.
                He has discovered 39 landmines and 28 items of unexploded ordnance to date, making him the charity’s most successful ‘hero rat’. During his career he has helped clear over 141,000 square meters of land (the equivalent of twenty football pitches), making that land safe for local people again.
                Magawa was formally presented with his miniature Gold Medal from veterinary charity The People’s Dispensary for Sick Animals (PDSA) via a live link between Cambodia and Great Britain last week.

                There may be a good reason for why we love to watch little piglets and fluffy ducks online.
                Seeing adorable animals actually helps to reduce stress levels in humans, researchers at England’s University of Leeds have found.
                And we don’t need to see adorable critters in real life for them to have an impact on our sense of wellbeing.
                Partnering with Tourism Western Australia, the University of Leeds explored the physiological and psychological impact of ‘cute’ animals on students and staff at the college.
                In fact, across all measures there was a drop in anxiety and stress as a result of watching the short slide show.
